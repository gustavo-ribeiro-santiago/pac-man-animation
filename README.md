## Pac-Man Animation

### Description

This repository contains a simple PacMan animation. The player can create multiple PacMen that move around the screen and bounce off the walls once the game starts. The PacMen change directions and display different images to create a fun and interactive animation.

## How to Run

Access web page [here](gustavo-ribeiro-santiago.github.io/pac-man-animation) or clone this repository and open 'index.html' to run it on your local machine.

## Roadmap of future improvements

- Create a shrinking effect when the PacMen bounce off the walls
